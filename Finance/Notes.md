## 3.1 Valuation of Common Stock
The value of an asset is the present value of its expected **future cashflow**.
|**Future cashflow**: Refers to *future dividends* and *future capital gains*|
|---|

**Ways to estimate future cashflow:**
1. Zero Growth
2. Constant Growth
3. Differential Growth
### 3.1.1 Zero Growth
* Dividend does not grow over time => Dividend remains constant
* Dividend remains constant => Future cashflow remains constant
* A dividend that pays the same present value forever is called a **perpetuity**

|**Perpetuity**: Refers to an asset hat pays a stated return for an infinite time.|
|---|

Equation: \
$`
P_0 = \frac{Div_{t=1}}{(1+R)^1} + \frac{Div_{t=2}}{(1+R)^2} + \frac{Div_{t=3}}{(1+R)^3} + ... + \frac{Div_{t=\infty}}{(1+R)^\infty} = \frac{Div}{R}
`$ 

**Note**: No indication for which time period $`Div`$ is in (eg. $`Div_0`$ or $`Div_1`$) because they are ALL THE SAME.

Therefore, in a zero growth model, the stock valuation is simply the present value of all future cashflows.\
This is the constant dividend divided by the cost of capital.

### 3.1.2 Constant Growth
* Dividend grows at a constant growth rate $`g`$
* Divident grows at a constant rate = Future cashflow grows at a constant rate
* A dividend that grows at a constant rate forever is called a **growing perpetuity**

**Equation:** \
$`Div_{t=1} = Div_{t=0}(1+g)`$ \
$`Div_{t=2} = Div_{t=1}(1+g) = Div_{t=0}(1+g)^2`$ \
$`Div_{t=3} = Div_{t=2}(1+g) = Div_{t=0}(1+g)^3`$ \
$`...`$ \
$`Div_{t=n} = Div_{t=n-1}(1+g) = Div_{t=0}(1+g)^n`$ \
\
**This reduces to:** \
$`P_n = \frac{Div_{t=n+1}}{R-g} `$

**Note:** The numerator of this formula is $`Div_1`$ and NOT $`Div_0`$.
**Note:** This formula calculates the CURRENT ($`t=0`$) perpetuity using the NEXT ($`t=1`$) period's dividend.

**Constant Growth Example** \
Just paid dividend = $`Div_0`$ = $0.50 \
Growth of dividend per year = $`g`$ = 2% \
Return on capital = $`R`$ = 15% 

Hence selling price of the stock = $`P_0 = \frac{Div_0(1+g)}{R-g} = \frac{0.50 \times (1+0.02)}{0.15 - 0.02}`$ = $3.92
